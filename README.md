This is the code for my custom jekyll pages blog. 

I use custom plugins which are not supported by Github.

So, I maintain my code here, rebuild my blog locally on changes, and update my blog with the
rebuilt `_site` folder after I make changes.   

This combined with a `.nojekyll` file in the blog repo allows hosting without build in github jekyll 

The advantage of this custom jekyll configuration:  

1. All of my categories are dynamically generated and paginated.
      * thanks to the sweet plugin from here: https://github.com/midnightSuyama/jekyll-paginate-category
2. Archives are dynamically generated.
3. Pages in their own folder: `_pages`.
4. Assets in their own folder
5. HTML5 boilerplate, Jquery, Bootstrap included.

"What's missing from pop music is danger."  
-Prince

After listening to countless varying types of music over my 20ish year music listening history, a good deal of music sort of all starts to blur together into an indistinguishable pulp. <br/>

Combine the common ABABCB structure, the similar instruments, effects, rhythym, and the vague abstract lyrics... you get the concept of "Music as furniture".  

It's just there. It makes me comfortable. It keeps my ass from hurting.

Don't get me wrong there's quality pop music being released consistently, stuff I listen to on a regular basis, that's enjoyable.

The artist has good style, the music is entertaining, the conversation about it is interesting, I sing along to it when no one is in the car, and life goes on.

However, there are times..   
times deep inside..  
when I yearn.  

I yearn for a higher standard. I yearn for something exciting and new.

I yearn for my ass to feel good AND my soul to be inspired. 

That's why it was refreshing for me to discover, not just a new band, but an new GENRE of fresh juicy music.  
(I know Math Rock has been around forever but it feels as if we're now entering its glory days.)

Math rock is a rhythmically complex, guitar-based style of experimental rock that emerged in the late 1980s. It is characterized by complex, atypical rhythmic structures (including irregular stopping and starting), angular melodies, and dissonant chords.
